# PyRoyale
A preliminary open-source emulator for Mario Royale browser game.

I really liked the idea of this game and as I already imagined that it would fall for the DMCA so I made a server for it, but this server is not currently the best thing in the world, its purpose is to only allow playing with friends, the use of it to other reasons can be dangerous since it has no anti-hack protection.
